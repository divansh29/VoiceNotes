## üöÄ **How to Test AI Integration**

### **Step 1: Build and Install**
```bash
# Build the APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install on device
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### **Step 2: Test Mock AI (Free)**
1. **Open VoiceNotes app**
2. **Record a voice note** (speak for 10+ seconds)
3. **Check results:**
   - Should show mock transcript
   - Should generate mock summary
   - Should extract mock action items
   - Should show mock keywords

### **Step 3: Configure Real AI**
1. **Go to Settings** ‚Üí **AI Settings**
2. **Enable "Real AI Processing"**
3. **Select providers:**
   - STT: OpenAI Whisper (recommended)
   - LLM: OpenAI GPT (recommended)
4. **Enter API key:**
   - Get from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Format: `sk-...`
5. **Save settings**

### **Step 4: Test Real AI**
1. **Record a new voice note**
2. **Wait for processing** (may take 10-30 seconds)
3. **Compare results:**
   - Real transcript vs mock
   - AI-generated summary
   - Intelligent action items
   - Relevant keywords

## üîç **Debugging AI Issues**

### **If Transcription Fails:**
```
Check logs: adb logcat | grep "SpeechToTextService"
Common issues:
- Invalid API key
- No internet connection
- Audio file format not supported
- API quota exceeded
```

### **If LLM Analysis Fails:**
```
Check logs: adb logcat | grep "LLMService"
Common issues:
- Invalid API key
- Request timeout
- Token limit exceeded
- API rate limiting
```

### **If Mock AI Doesn't Work:**
```
Check logs: adb logcat | grep "AIService"
This indicates a basic app issue, not AI-specific
```

## üìä **Performance Expectations**

### **Mock AI (Instant):**
- Transcription: Immediate
- Analysis: Immediate
- Total time: < 1 second

### **Real AI (Network-dependent):**
- Transcription: 5-15 seconds
- Analysis: 3-10 seconds  
- Total time: 8-25 seconds

### **Optimization Tips:**
1. **Use shorter recordings** for faster processing
2. **Good internet connection** reduces latency
3. **Choose faster providers** (Google > OpenAI > Anthropic)
4. **Batch process** multiple files
